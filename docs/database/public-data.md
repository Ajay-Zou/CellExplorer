# Public data
{: .fs-9 }
We are sharing a large set of cells that is available to explore or use as reference data for classifying your own data. Any sessions located in the repository **NYUshare_Datasets** is publicly available and can be downloaded and loaded automatically in the Cell Explorer, without providing any database credentials. Upon request the data will be downloaded from our [public web share](https://buzsakilab.nyumc.org/datasets/) and saved to the local Cell Explorer directory `referenceData/` for future access. The various plotting options are shown below. Learn more about our public data [here](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/2018/10/29/public-datasets/).
