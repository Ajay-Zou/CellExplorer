# Graphical interface
{: .no_toc}
The interface consists of 4-9 main plots, where the top row is dedicated to population level representations of the cells and the other plots are [selectable and customizable plots for individual cells](/interface/single-cell-plot-options/) (including variations of waveforms, ACGs, ISIs, CCGs, PSTHs, response curves and firing rate maps). The surrounding interface consists of 7 panels placed on either side of the graphs: On the right side there is a navigation panel, cell assignment panel, display settings panel, and on the left side a plot selection panel, color group panel and a table with cell metrics. The panels are described in details below. Further there is a text field for custom text filter, a message log and figure legends. There are [keyboard shortcuts](http://localhost:4000/interface/keyboard-shortcuts/) that allow you to quickly navigate your data. Press H in the cell Explorer to learn Keyboard shortcuts.
