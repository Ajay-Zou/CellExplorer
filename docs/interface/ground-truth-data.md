# Ground truth data
{: .no_toc}
At present (September 2020) the list includes PV, SST, Axo-axonic cells, VGAT and VIP cells and will continuesly be expanded with a further cells. The plan is to ultimately do classification from ground truth cell metrics so if you have opto-tagged data that you are interested in sharing/including, please reach out to us. Please see the [ground truth tutorial]({{"/tutorials/ground-truth-tutorial/"|absolute_url}}) to learn more about using the included ground truth data. The table below shows the current cell-types, their counts and the contributers:

| Cell-type  | Count | Contributers |
|:-----------|:------|:------|
| PV         | 184   | Josh Siegle with the Allen Institute; Sam McKenzie & Yuta Senzai, Buzsaki lab |
| SST        | 115   | Josh Siegle with the Allen Institute |
| Axo-axonic | 35    | Dan English & Sam McKenzie, Buzsaki lab |
| VGAT       | 15    | Yuta Senzai, Buzsaki lab |
| VIP        | 14    | Josh Siegle with the Allen Institute |

### Classifying your cells in CellExplorer
You can also implement your own ground truth cells into the pipeline or do the classification in CellExplorer. Once classified you can share your metrics list with collaborators or provide them for publications.

Please see the [opto-tagging tutorial]({{"/tutorials/optotagging-tutorial/"|absolute_url}}) for how to do the ground truth classification on your own data.
