# Ground truth data
{: .no_toc}
A small selection of ground truth cells are included. This list will be expanded with a greater selection and cell count. The plan is to ultimately do classification from ground truth cell metrics so if you have opto-tagged data that you are interested in sharing/including, please reach out to me.

You can also implement your own ground truth cells into the pipeline or do the classification in the Cell Explorer. Once classified you can share your metrics list with collaborators or provide them for publications.
