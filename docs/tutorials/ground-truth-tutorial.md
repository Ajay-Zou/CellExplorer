# Ground truth data tutorial (draft)
{: .no_toc}
The Cell Explorer contains a select set of ground truth data located at `groundTruthData/`. This tutorial will guide you through using the ground truth data included with the Cell Explorer.

1. Launch the Cell Explorer
2. From the top menu `Ground truth`, select `Define ground truth data`. This will display a dialog with a list of sessions with ground truth cells. Each session contains at least one tagged cell but can contain more cells. 
3. Select the sessions you would like to load as ground truth data.
4. From the `Ground truth` menu, you can select how to display the ground truth data: as scatter points, or as a density map (image).
5. You can select which of the ground truth cell types to display in the Display Settings tab group `GroundTruth`

Once a selection has been made, you can skip step 2 and 3. If you have data that you are interested in sharing please contact us. See the optotagging tutorial for how to add your own data to the ground truth selection. The ground truth cells has a label in `cell_metrics.groundTruthClassification`.
