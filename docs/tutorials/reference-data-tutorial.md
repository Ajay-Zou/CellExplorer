# Tutorial on reference data (draft)
{: .no_toc}
The Buzsaki lab is sharing a large set of datasets and a large set of these sessions are also shared with cell metrics that can be downloaded and displayed directly in the Cell Explorer. Learn more about our public data [here](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/2018/10/29/public-datasets/). This tutorial will guide you through the process of using reference data in the manual curation process and for comparison with your own data.

1. Launch the Cell Explorer
2. From the top menu `Reference data`, select `'Define reference data'`. This will display the dialog below:

3. Select the sessions you would like to load as reference data. All data located at the repository `NYUshare_Datasets` are publicly available and will be downloaded to your computer upon request. For sessions located on private data repositories, you have to specify the local path the the repository in the file `db_local_repositories`
4. The data can be shown in two ways: as scatter points, or as a density map (image) from the `Reference data` menu.
5. You can select which of the reference cell types to display in the Display Settings tab group `Reference`.

Once a selection has been made, you can skip step 2 and 3. The video below shows the steps in the Cell Explorer:
