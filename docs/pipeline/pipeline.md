# Processing pipeline
{: .no_toc}
The pipeline has three main processing steps: 1. Gathering metadata, 2. Processing cell_metrics and 3. Running Cell Explorer. All metrics are calculated using a single processing script. To run the pipeline one have to prepare the compatible data structure and metadata. You can add your own metrics and custom calculations to the pipeline.
